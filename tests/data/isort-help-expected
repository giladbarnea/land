--sg SKIP_GLOB, --skip-glob SKIP_GLOB
                      Files that isort should skip over.
--extend-skip-glob EXTEND_SKIP_GLOB
                      Additional files that isort should skip over
                      (extending --skip-glob).
--gitignore, --skip-gitignore
                      Treat project as a git repository and ignore files
                      listed in .gitignore. NOTE: This requires git to be
                      installed and accessible from the same shell as isort.
--ext SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS, --extension SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS, --supported-extension SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS
                      Specifies what extensions isort can be run against.
--blocked-extension BLOCKED_EXTENSIONS
                      Specifies what extensions isort can never be run
                      against.
--dont-follow-links   Tells isort not to follow symlinks that are
                      encountered when running recursively.
--filename FILENAME   Provide the filename associated with a stream.
--allow-root          Tells isort not to treat / specially, allowing it to
                      be run against the root dir.

general output options:
-a ADD_IMPORTS, --add-import ADD_IMPORTS
                      Adds the specified import line to all files,
                      automatically determining correct placement.
--append, --append-only
                      Only adds the imports specified in --add-import if the
                      file contains existing imports.
--af, --force-adds    Forces import adds even if the original file is empty.
--rm REMOVE_IMPORTS, --remove-import REMOVE_IMPORTS
                      Removes the specified import from all files.
--float-to-top        Causes all non-indented imports to float to the top of
                      the file having its imports sorted (immediately below
                      the top of file comment). This can be an excellent
                      shortcut for collecting imports every once in a while
                      when you place them in the middle of a file to avoid
                      context switching. *NOTE*: It currently doesn't work
                      with cimports and introduces some extra over-head and
                      a performance penalty.
--dont-float-to-top   Forces --float-to-top setting off. See --float-to-top
                      for more information.
--ca, --combine-as    Combines as imports on the same line.
--cs, --combine-star  Ensures that if a star import is present, nothing else
                      is imported from that namespace.
-e, --balanced        Balances wrapping to produce the most consistent line
                      length possible
--ff, --from-first    Switches the typical ordering preference, showing from
                      imports first then straight ones.
--fgw [FORCE_GRID_WRAP], --force-grid-wrap [FORCE_GRID_WRAP]
                      Force number of from imports (defaults to 2 when
                      passed as CLI flag without value) to be grid wrapped
                      regardless of line length. If 0 is passed in (the
                      global default) only line length is considered.
-i INDENT, --indent INDENT
                      String to place for indents defaults to " " (4
                      spaces).
--lbi LINES_BEFORE_IMPORTS, --lines-before-imports LINES_BEFORE_IMPORTS
--lai LINES_AFTER_IMPORTS, --lines-after-imports LINES_AFTER_IMPORTS
--lbt LINES_BETWEEN_TYPES, --lines-between-types LINES_BETWEEN_TYPES
--le LINE_ENDING, --line-ending LINE_ENDING
                      Forces line endings to the specified value. If not
                      set, values will be guessed per-file.
--ls, --length-sort   Sort imports by their string length.
--lss, --length-sort-straight
                      Sort straight imports by their string length. Similar
                      to `length_sort` but applies only to straight imports
                      and doesn't affect from imports.
-m {GRID,VERTICAL,HANGING_INDENT,VERTICAL_HANGING_INDENT,VERTICAL_GRID,VERTICAL_GRID_GROUPED,VERTICAL_GRID_GROUPED_NO_COMMA,NOQA,VERTICAL_HANGING_INDENT_BRACKET,VERTICAL_PREFIX_FROM_MODULE_IMPORT,HANGING_INDENT_WITH_PARENTHESES,BACKSLASH_GRID,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}, --multi-line {GRID,VERTICAL,HANGING_INDENT,VERTICAL_HANGING_INDENT,VERTICAL_GRID,VERTICAL_GRID_GROUPED,VERTICAL_GRID_GROUPED_NO_COMMA,NOQA,VERTICAL_HANGING_INDENT_BRACKET,VERTICAL_PREFIX_FROM_MODULE_IMPORT,HANGING_INDENT_WITH_PARENTHESES,BACKSLASH_GRID,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}
                      Multi line output (0-grid, 1-vertical, 2-hanging,
                      3-vert-hanging, 4-vert-grid, 5-vert-grid-grouped,
                      6-deprecated-alias-for-5, 7-noqa, 8-vertical-hanging-

                      10-hanging-indent-with-parentheses).
-n, --ensure-newline-before-comments
                      Inserts a blank line before a comment following an
                      import.
--nis, --no-inline-sort
                      Leaves `from` imports with multiple imports 'as-is'
                      (e.g. `from foo import a, c ,b`).
--ot, --order-by-type
                      Order imports by type, which is determined by case, in
                      addition to alphabetically. **NOTE**: type here refers
                      to the implied type from the import name
                      capitalization. isort does not do type introspection
                      for the imports. These "types" are simply:
                      CONSTANT_VARIABLE, CamelCaseClass,
                      variable_or_function. If your project follows PEP8 or
                      a related coding standard and has many imports this is
                      a good default, otherwise you likely will want to turn
                      it off. From the CLI the `--dont-order-by-type` option
                      will turn this off.
--dt, --dont-order-by-type
                      Don't order imports by type, which is determined by
                      case, in addition to alphabetically. **NOTE**: type
                      here refers to the implied type from the import name
                      capitalization. isort does not do type introspection
                      for the imports. These "types" are simply:
                      CONSTANT_VARIABLE, CamelCaseClass,
                      variable_or_function. If your project follows PEP8 or
                      a related coding standard and has many imports this is
                      a good default. You can turn this on from the CLI
                      using `--order-by-type`.
--rr, --reverse-relative
                      Reverse order of relative imports.
--reverse-sort        Reverses the ordering of imports.
--sort-order SORT_ORDER
                      Specify sorting function. Can be built in
                      (natural[default] = force numbers to be sequential,
                      native = Python's built-in sorted function) or an
                      installable plugin.
--sl, --force-single-line-imports
                      Forces all from imports to appear on their own line
--nsl SINGLE_LINE_EXCLUSIONS, --single-line-exclusions SINGLE_LINE_EXCLUSIONS
                      One or more modules to exclude from the single line
                      rule.
--tc, --trailing-comma
                      Includes a trailing comma on multi line imports that
                      include parentheses.
--up, --use-parentheses
                      Use parentheses for line continuation on length limit
                      instead of slashes. **NOTE**: This is separate from
                      wrap modes, and only affects how individual lines that
                      are too long get continued, not sections of multiple
                      imports.
-l LINE_LENGTH, -w LINE_LENGTH, --line-length LINE_LENGTH, --line-width LINE_LENGTH
                      The max length of an import line (used for wrapping
                      long imports).
--wl WRAP_LENGTH, --wrap-length WRAP_LENGTH
                      Specifies how long lines that are wrapped should be,
                      if not set line_length is used. NOTE: wrap_length must
                      be LOWER than or equal to line_length.
--case-sensitive      Tells isort to include casing when sorting module
                      names
--remove-redundant-aliases
                      Tells isort to remove redundant aliases from imports,
                      such as `import os as os`. This defaults to `False`
                      simply because some projects use these seemingly
                      useless aliases to signify intent and change
                      behaviour.
--honor-noqa          Tells isort to honor noqa comments to enforce skipping
                      those comments.
--treat-comment-as-code TREAT_COMMENTS_AS_CODE
                      Tells isort to treat the specified single line
                      comment(s) as if they are code.
--treat-all-comment-as-code
                      Tells isort to treat all single line comments as if
                      they are code.
--formatter FORMATTER
                      Specifies the name of a formatting plugin to use when
                      producing output.
--color               Tells isort to use color in terminal output.
--ext-format EXT_FORMAT
                      Tells isort to format the given files according to an
                      extensions formatting rules.
--star-first          Forces star imports above others to avoid overriding
                      directly imported variables.
--split-on-trailing-comma
                      Split imports list followed by a trailing comma into
                      VERTICAL_HANGING_INDENT mode

section output options:
--sd DEFAULT_SECTION, --section-default DEFAULT_SECTION
                      Sets the default section for import options:
                      ('FUTURE', 'STDLIB', 'THIRDPARTY', 'FIRSTPARTY',
                      'LOCALFOLDER')
--only-sections, --os
                      Causes imports to be sorted based on their sections
                      like STDLIB, THIRDPARTY, etc. Within sections, the
                      imports are ordered by their import style and the
                      imports with the same style maintain their relative
                      positions.
--ds, --no-sections   Put all imports into the same section bucket
--fas, --force-alphabetical-sort
                      Force all imports to be sorted as a single section
--fss, --force-sort-within-sections
                      Don't sort straight-style imports (like import sys)
                      before from-style imports (like from itertools import
                      groupby). Instead, sort the imports by module,
                      independent of import style.
--hcss, --honor-case-in-force-sorted-sections
                      Honor `--case-sensitive` when `--force-sort-within-
                      sections` is being used. Without this option set,
                      `--order-by-type` decides module name ordering too.
--srss, --sort-relative-in-force-sorted-sections
                      When using `--force-sort-within-sections`, sort
                      relative imports the same way as they are sorted when
                      not using that setting.
--fass, --force-alphabetical-sort-within-sections
                      Force all imports to be sorted alphabetically within a
                      section
-t FORCE_TO_TOP, --top FORCE_TO_TOP
                      Force specific imports to the top of their appropriate
                      section.
--combine-straight-imports, --csi
                      Combines all the bare straight imports of the same
                      section in a single line. Won't work with sections
                      which have 'as' imports
--nlb NO_LINES_BEFORE, --no-lines-before NO_LINES_BEFORE
                      Sections which should not be split with previous by
                      empty lines
--src SRC_PATHS, --src-path SRC_PATHS
                      Add an explicitly defined source path (modules within
                      src paths have their imports automatically categorized
                      as first_party). Glob expansion (`*` and `**`) is
                      supported for this option.
-b KNOWN_STANDARD_LIBRARY, --builtin KNOWN_STANDARD_LIBRARY
                      Force isort to recognize a module as part of Python's
                      standard library.
--extra-builtin EXTRA_STANDARD_LIBRARY
                      Extra modules to be included in the list of ones in
                      Python's standard library.
-f KNOWN_FUTURE_LIBRARY, --future KNOWN_FUTURE_LIBRARY
                      Force isort to recognize a module as part of Python's
                      internal future compatibility libraries. WARNING: this
                      overrides the behavior of __future__ handling and
                      therefore can result in code that can't execute. If
                      you're looking to add dependencies such as six, a
                      better option is to create another section below
                      --future using custom sections. See:
                      https://github.com/PyCQA/isort#custom-sections-and-
                      ordering and the discussion here:
                      https://github.com/PyCQA/isort/issues/1463.
-o KNOWN_THIRD_PARTY, --thirdparty KNOWN_THIRD_PARTY
                      Force isort to recognize a module as being part of a
                      third party library.
-p KNOWN_FIRST_PARTY, --project KNOWN_FIRST_PARTY
                      Force isort to recognize a module as being part of the
                      current python project.
--known-local-folder KNOWN_LOCAL_FOLDER
                      Force isort to recognize a module as being a local
                      folder. Generally, this is reserved for relative
                      imports (from . import module).
--virtual-env VIRTUAL_ENV
                      Virtual environment to use for determining whether a
                      package is third-party
--conda-env CONDA_ENV
                      Conda environment to use for determining whether a
                      package is third-party
--py {all,2,27,3,310,311,36,37,38,39,auto}, --python-version {all,2,27,3,310,311,36,37,38,39,auto}
                      Tells isort to set the known standard library based on
                      the specified Python version. Default is to assume any
                      Python 3 version could be the target, and use a union
                      of all stdlib modules across versions. If auto is
                      specified, the version of the interpreter used to run
                      isort (currently: 310) will be used.
